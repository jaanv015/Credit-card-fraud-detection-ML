# Credit-card-fraud-detection-ML
## Description
The aim of this project is to predict whether the credit card transaction that has taken place is either a fraud or genuine. 
This is important for companies that have transaction systems to build a model for detecting fraudulent activities.
Input or featured variables are Time, V1, V2, … V28 and Amount. Due to confidentiality issues, original features and 
more background information about the data cannot be provided. 
The output or dependentvariable is Class and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.

The following machine-learning classification models were used: decision tree, random forest, support vector, etc. 
Evaluation metrics, such as the accuracy score, were calculated to evaluate the accuracy of the models. 
Various models were tested to determine which classification model had the highest accuracy.

## Implementation
### Data acquisition
Dataset has been downloaded from Kaggle. Link to dataset: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud">Credit Card Fraud Dataset</a>

### Data modelling
Machine learning models such as decision tree, random forest classifier, multilayer perceptron, and support vector classifier
are used to classify data based on whether or not credit card fraud has occurred, and to determine which model has the highest accuracy for usage in transaction systems.
